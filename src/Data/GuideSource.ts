Second, the assembler directive .space, which tells the assembler to reserve bytes in the data segment. Finally, the number 40, which tells the assembler how many bytes to reserve. You might have noticed the declaration does not include a data type. In programming languages like c, the size of an array is automatically calculated by multiplying the number of items by each item's size. In MIPS, you must do this manually. For example, integers in MIPS have a size of 4 bytes. Thus, an array of 10 integers requires 10 Ã— 4 = 40 bytes."},

Arrays store items one after another in memory, so to access a specific item you must first determine where the array begins in memory, then determine the item's offset within the array. Finding the memory address where an array starts can be done with the load address pseudoinstruction:"},

When done correctly, the first register specified is the value to be stored, and the second register specified is the memory location where the item should be stored.
